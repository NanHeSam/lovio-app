# Rebase Resolution Guide

## Current Situation
The rebase operation got stuck during the process, but the actual merge conflict has been successfully resolved. The terminal session became unresponsive, but the repository is in a recoverable state.

## Status Summary
✅ **Merge conflict resolved**: The Navigation.tsx conflict has been properly merged
✅ **Files staged**: All new profile-related files are ready
✅ **Rebase almost complete**: The git-rebase-todo file is empty, indicating completion
❌ **Process stuck**: The git rebase --continue command timed out

## Manual Resolution Steps

### Option 1: Complete the Rebase (Recommended)
Open a new terminal and run these commands:

```bash
cd /workspace

# Check current status
git status

# Try to continue the rebase
git rebase --continue

# If that completes successfully, check the final status
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

### Option 2: Force Complete the Rebase
If Option 1 doesn't work:

```bash
cd /workspace

# Clean up the stuck rebase state
rm -rf .git/rebase-merge
rm -f .git/REBASE_HEAD .git/AUTO_MERGE .git/MERGE_MSG

# Check status
git status

# If you're on a detached HEAD, switch back to your branch
git checkout cursor/implement-user-profile-page-with-edit-functionality-b2b6

# Force the rebase
git rebase origin/main
```

### Option 3: Alternative Merge Approach
If rebasing continues to have issues:

```bash
cd /workspace

# Abort any ongoing rebase
git rebase --abort

# Switch to main and pull latest
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Switch back to feature branch
git checkout cursor/implement-user-profile-page-with-edit-functionality-b2b6

# Use merge instead of rebase
git merge main
```

## Verification Steps
After resolving, verify that:

1. **All files are present**:
   ```bash
   ls -la app/profile/
   ls -la app/api/user/profile/
   ls -la app/api/children/[childId]/
   ```

2. **Navigation includes both items**:
   ```bash
   grep -A 10 "navItems = " components/Navigation.tsx
   ```

3. **No conflict markers remain**:
   ```bash
   grep -r "<<<<<<< " .
   grep -r ">>>>>>> " .
   ```

## Files Successfully Implemented
- ✅ `app/profile/page.tsx` - Main profile page
- ✅ `app/profile/components/ProfileForm.tsx` - Profile form component  
- ✅ `app/api/user/profile/route.ts` - User profile update API
- ✅ `app/api/children/[childId]/route.ts` - Child update API
- ✅ `components/ui/input.tsx` - Input component
- ✅ `components/ui/label.tsx` - Label component
- ✅ `components/Navigation.tsx` - Updated with Profile navigation
- ✅ `USER_PROFILE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete documentation

## Conflict Resolution Applied
The merge conflict in `components/Navigation.tsx` was resolved by:
- ✅ Including both "API Keys" (from main) and "Profile" (from feature) navigation items
- ✅ Importing both `Key` and `User` icons from lucide-react
- ✅ Maintaining proper navigation order and structure

## Next Steps After Resolution
1. Test the profile page by navigating to `/profile`
2. Verify both user and children editing functionality
3. Ensure the navigation shows both "API Keys" and "Profile" items
4. Push the updated branch to remote

## If You Need Help
If you encounter any issues with these steps, the repository state is safe and all your work is preserved. The conflict has been properly resolved, and the feature implementation is complete.
